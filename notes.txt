Data Architect - exactly like building a house, design house buleprint

                design how data will flow, integrate and be accessed. be scalable

                step 1: choose type of Data Architecture
                    1. data warehouse - structured data
                    2. data lake - flexible, semi,      unstructure along with structured
                    3. data lakehouse - mix of above. get flexibility of having any type of data and u can still organize and structure data
                    4. Data mesh - decentralized dms. 

                            1. Create a DWH
                        Inmon - sources -> stage -> enterprise dwh (3NF) -> data marts (design data for consumption) -> report
                        Stage

                        Kimball - stage -> data marts -> report - save time

                        Data vault - stage -> raw vault -> business vault -> data marts -> report

                        Medallion Architecture - source -> bronze [raw, unprocessed data, traceability and debugging] - Table - Full load[truncate and insert] - no transformation of data - no change in data model -
                         data engineers 

                         -> silver [clean, standardized data, prepare for analysis] Table - Full load - 
                         data cleaning, standardization, normalization, dervied columns, enrichment -  no change in data model - 
                         data analysis, engineers

                         -> gold   [business ready data, for analysis] - Views - none - 
                         data integration, aggregation, business rules and logic - 
                         start schema, aggregated object, flat tables (data models) - 
                         data analysist
                         business users

Separation of concerns
 break complex system into small simple part, each component is responsible for a function as seen above, each layer has own unique task -  important in data Architecture.
